<h1>The Best Movies From Lewis </h1>
<h2>My top three movies </h2>
<hr/>
<h3>Chronicle</h3> 
<p>The way the movie was presented always though a camera was incredible and the relationship between the kids made you feel it was Real</p>
<h3>Spider-Man across the spider verse </h3>
<p>The first Spider-Man animated movies that could compare with the live action Spider-Man movies</p>
<h3>Forrest Gump</h3>
<p>Just a genuinely entertaining movie</p>
